//  LDAP extended controls are an extensibility mechanism in version 3 of LDAP,
//  as discussed in [RFC2251] section 4.1.12. The following sections describe
//  the LDAP extended controls implemented by DCs in Windows 2000 operating
//  system and later (both AD DS and AD LDS).
//
//   The LDAP extended controls supported by a DC are exposed as OIDs in the
//   supportedControl attribute of the rootDSE. Each OID corresponds to a
//   human-readable name, as shown in the following table.
//
//   Extended control name                     | OID

//
//  LDAP extended operations are an extensibility mechanism in version 3 of
//  LDAP, as discussed in [RFC2251] section 4.12. The following sections
//  describe the LDAP extended operations that are implemented by DCs in
//  Windows Server 2003 operating system and later (including Active
//  Directory Application Mode (ADAM)).
//
//  The LDAP extended operations supported by a DC are exposed as OIDs in the
//  supportedExtension attribute of the rootDSE. Each OID is mapped to a
//  human-readable name as shown in the following table.
//
//   Extended operation name        | OID

//
//  The following sections describe the matching rules supported by DCs when
//  performing LDAP search requests. Unlike, for example, extended controls
//  and extended operations, there is no attribute exposed by the DC that
//  specifies which matching rules it supports. The identifiers for these
//  matching rules are used in an extensibleMatch clause in the filter
//  portion of a SearchRequest, as described in [RFC2251] section 4.5.1.
//  Matching rules are identified by an OID that corresponds to a
//  human-readable name, as shown in the following table.
//
//   Capability name                     | OID
