I. Introduction
---------------


This package was developed to provide a set of tools to assist in fullfilling
requests for data and in performing maintenance on LDAP servers.  When applicable,
the command line switches for the OpenLDAP tools were used in this package.


II. Reporting Problems
----------------------

Please report problems regarding this package using the SourceForge Tracker.

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=214270
	</a>

If the Tracker is too confusing, time consuming, detailed, arbitrary, ridiculous,
chaotic, organized, purlple, "I don't speak your crazy moon-language."; send the
request to:

	<a href=mailto:syzdek@users.sourceforge.net>
	syzdek@users.sourceforge.net

This project is hosted on SourceForge.  The source code can be downloaded from the
following web page:

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-utils/
	</a>

The latest source code can be retieved from Git using the following commands:

	git clone git://git.scm.syzdek.net/pub/scm/devel/ldap-utils.git

The package should be copied to a directory called `ldap-utils' which contains
the latest development source.


IV. Compiling and Installing
----------------------------

This project uses GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake, and GNU Libtool in order to ease
porting source across multiple platforms.  As of this writing the source was 
known to compile for the following platforms:

        Apple OS X 10.5.1
        Slackware Linux 11.0
	FreeBSD 4.9 (With GNU Getopt)

The easist way to compile the source on a Unix platform is to run the following:

        gzip -cd ldap-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
        cd ldap-utils-x.x.x
        ./configure
        make
        make install

For more information on building and installing using configure, please read the
INSTALL file.


V. Notes for Maintainers
