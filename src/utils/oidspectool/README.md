This is a simple parser which combines individual OID specifications into a
single source file which contains a sorted array of OID specificications. The
alternative was to manually maintain a monolithic list of OID specifications in
source. Full disclaimer, I was recovering from treatment of Alemtuzumab when I
learned Lex/Yacc and wrote this utility. So if this utility automates the OID
maintenance and reduces errors in the specification, GREAT!!  If not, at least
focusing on this project kept the world from spinning around me as lymphocytes
smuggling CD52 were exterminated by monoclonal antibodies roaming my
bloodstream.
